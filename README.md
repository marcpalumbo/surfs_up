# Surfs Up Weather Summary

The Purpose of this quick anaylsis was to get historical weather data from June and December to see if W. Avy's surf shop will be successful year-round. We used SQLite to host this historical data they provided us. We then converted this data after filtering for the months needed to store it in a pandas dataframe so we could evaluate based on summary statistics.

## June
After Evaulating the month of June, with 1700 records, it was found that the average temprature was just under 75 degrees, with  a low of 64 degrees and standard deviation of 3.25. This can be considered stellar surfing conditions. The 1st and 3rd quartiles are all ideal conditions, since its all ranging in the mid 70's. A wonderful month for surfing!

## December
December had 1,517 rows to evaluate. The average temprature in this month was 71 degrees. This is what I would personally consider borderline for surfing conditions. While I do not personally surf and cannot provide personal opinions on the matter, I would imagine it has potential to get cold partaking in a water activity in 71 degree weather. 

Similarly to June, there is not much deviation on a day to day basis with a standard deviation of 3.75 rounded. This consistency will help W. Avy as those that do surf may do continue to do it despite the colder weather if they are persistent with their hobbies. It is worth noting that even in one of the colder months of the year the highest recorded temprature was still in the 80's, so I do believe that this surf shop has reason to be optimistic about year-round success. 

##conclusion

In conclusion I believe it is safe to say that this surf shop should get and running. With ideal Summer months and doable winter months, there is no reason to think that they will lack success.
